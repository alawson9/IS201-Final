                        <p>My name is Aliya Lawson and this is an insight into my life!</p>
                        <p>I am currently a sophmore here at BYU and I will be majoring in accounting at UVU.</p>
                        <p>I come from a family of four with me being the youngest. My older brother's name is Tyler who is 25. He is a private pilot and is working on getting his commercial license. He has a silly cat named Kit-Kat that always keeps him on his toes! My parents are some of the most amazing people, in my opinion. They have given me so many opportunities to grow as a person and I thank them for that so much.</p>

                        <img src="assets/img/Tyler.HEIC" alt="Tyler" height="400" width="500">
                        <p>My family currenlty has two pets, one dog and one cat. Phoenix is our beautiful bernese mountain dog, he is almost 3, and Simba is our quirky black cat, he is 11. Both of these furry friends bring lots of happiness and excitment into my families lives.</p>

                        <img src="assets/img/Simba.JPG" alt="Simba" height="400" width="450">
                        <p>When I was nine my parents took me rock climbing for the first time. A year later I was on a team and not long after started competing for them. I competed for six years before I felt like it was my time to throw in the towel. During my time competing I was able to travel all throughout Utah and Colorado.</p>

                        <p>I have been able to go on various vacations while growing up. The one that stands out to me the most is when I went to Costa Rica a couple years ago. I went through an organization called TFY and was able to serve for a couple of days while I was there for two weeks. </p>

                        <p>I am lucky enough to have a boyfriend that brings lots of happiness to my life (and lots of headache). His name is Ian and we have been together for a little less than a year. He has two chubby dogs Zeus and Ollie.</p>
